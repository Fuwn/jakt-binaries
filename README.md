# Binaries

Binaries of Jakt built on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu are available as artifacts from
either [actions](https://github.com/Fuwn/jakt-binaries/actions) or
[releases](https://github.com/Fuwn/jakt-binaries/releases).

## Actions

The binaries from [actions](https://github.com/Fuwn/jakt-binaries/actions) will always
be the most recent, since they are built every ten minutes.

## Releases

The binaries from [releases](https://github.com/Fuwn/jakt-binaries/releases) will not
always be the most recent, since they have to be manually tagged and dispatched for
building. The release versions do not correlate with Jakt's versioning scheme; however,
they might in the future.
